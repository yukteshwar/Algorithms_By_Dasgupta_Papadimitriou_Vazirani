# Algorithms_By_Dasgupta_Papadimitriou_Vazirani

This repository is for practicing algorithms as an interdisciplinary skill. 
It contains solutions to book: Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani.
I found this book concise and easy to understand by practicing problems at the end of each chapter.
